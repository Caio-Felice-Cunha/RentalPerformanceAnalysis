## Business Problem
> Data source: [sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database from MySQL

The Sakila sample database was initially developed by Mike Hillyer, a former member of the MySQL AB documentation team. It is intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, and so forth. The Sakila sample database also serves to highlight features of MySQL such as Views, Stored Procedures, and Triggers.<br>

For this specific dataset, a brief analysis was performed regarding rental frequency, rental duration, and average rental 


## Business Assumptions
We assume that the data provided is complete and has been stored correctly. <br>
We also understand that Sakila wants to develop a service closer to the customer in the future. <br>
We know that the DVD rental industry is practically bankrupt, but we do not take this into account in the present case, as the intention is to analyze only the company's data.

## Solution Strategy
In order to achieve some valuable insights, we used the database query language, SQL.
